# dafrjulia - Data in Axes in Formats for R

The goal of dafrjulia is to provide R bindings for the
[DataAxesFormats.jl](https://github.com/tanaylab/DataAxesFormats.jl)
Julia package, which provides a uniform generic interface for accessing
1D and 2D data arranged along some set of axes. This is a much-needed
generalization of the [AnnData](https://github.com/scverse/anndata)
functionality.

The dafrjulia package enables R users to access `Daf` data using
familiar R interfaces while leveraging the powerful implementation
provided by the Julia package. The package follows a functional
interface similar to the Julia implementation, with some limitations due
to the limitations of JuliaCall (see
[below](#important-note-about-data-copying)).

## Installation

You can install the development version of dafrjulia from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tanaylab/dafrjulia")
```

Note that dafrjulia requires the Julia programming language and the
DataAxesFormats.jl package to be installed. The package uses
[JuliaCall](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall) to interface with
Julia from R.

## Usage

The R package provides an interface similar to the Julia package, with
functions that mirror the Julia API:

``` r

library(dafrjulia)
# Setup connection to Julia
setup_daf()
```

``` r

# Create a DAF object in memory
daf <- memory_daf("example")

# Add axes
add_axis(daf, "obs", c("cell1", "cell2", "cell3"))
add_axis(daf, "var", c("gene1", "gene2"))

# Add vector data
set_vector(daf, "obs", "score", c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))

# Add matrix data
mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
set_matrix(daf, "obs", "var", "counts", mat)

# Access data
get_vector(daf, "obs", "score")
#> cell1 cell2 cell3 
#>   0.1   0.5   0.9
get_matrix(daf, "obs", "var", "counts")
#>       gene1 gene2
#> cell1     1     4
#> cell2     2     5
#> cell3     3     6

# Get a dataframe view
get_dataframe(daf, "obs", c("score"))
#>       score
#> cell1   0.1
#> cell2   0.5
#> cell3   0.9
```

## Querying Data

One of the powerful features of dafrjulia is its query language. You can
use queries to access and transform data flexibly. The package provides
a convenient `[` operator for concise query syntax:

``` r

# Create a sample dataset
daf <- memory_daf("query_examples")
add_axis(daf, "cell", c("A", "B", "C"))
add_axis(daf, "gene", c("X", "Y", "Z"))
set_vector(daf, "cell", "age", c(1, 5, 10))
set_vector(daf, "cell", "type", c("T", "B", "NK"))
set_scalar(daf, "version", "1.0")
set_matrix(daf, "cell", "gene", "counts", matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3))

# Basic queries using the [ operator
# Get scalar values
daf[". version"] # Get a scalar
#> [1] "1.0"

# Access axes and properties
daf["@ ?"] # List all axes
#> [1] "gene" "cell"
daf["@ cell : ?"] # List properties of the "cell" axis
#> [1] "type" "age"

# Access vector data
daf["@ cell : age"] # Get the "age" vector for all cells
#>  A  B  C 
#>  1  5 10

# Access matrix data
daf["@ cell @ gene :: counts"] # Get the full counts matrix
#>   X Y Z
#> A 1 4 7
#> B 2 5 8
#> C 3 6 9

# Filter data
daf["@ cell [ age > 2 ] : type"] # Get types of cells with age > 2
#>    B    C 
#>  "B" "NK"

# Transform data
daf["@ cell : age % Abs"] # Get absolute values of ages
#>  A  B  C 
#>  1  5 10
daf["@ cell : age % Log base 2"] # Get log2 of ages
#>        A        B        C 
#> 0.000000 2.321928 3.321928

# Aggregations
daf["@ cell : age >> Max"] # Get maximum age
#> [1] 10
daf["@ cell : age >> Mean"] # Get mean age
#> [1] 5.333333

# Complex operations can be built using the pipe operator or query functions
# Get types of cells with age > 2
Axis("cell") |>
    BeginMask("age") |>
    IsGreater(2) |>
    EndMask() |>
    LookupVector("type") |>
    get_query(daf)
#>    B    C 
#>  "B" "NK"
```

The query syntax follows a simple pattern:

- `@ axis` selects an axis
- `. property` retrieves a scalar
- `: property` retrieves a vector property
- `:: property` retrieves a matrix property
- `% operation` applies an element-wise operation
- `>> reduction` applies a reduction operation
- `[ property comparison value ]` filters by a property

See the Julia
[documentation](https://tanaylab.github.io/DataAxesFormats.jl/v0.2.0/queries.html)
for more details about the query language.

### Note on Data Transfer

The dafrjulia package uses [jlview](https://github.com/tanaylab/jlview)
for zero-copy transfer of arrays from Julia to R. However, writing data
from R to Julia (e.g., via `set_vector` or `set_matrix`) still involves
copying through JuliaCall. This means that `get_empty_dense_vector`,
`get_empty_sparse_vector` and their matrix equivalents do not provide
the in-place filling benefit they offer in Julia.

## Key Features

The dafrjulia package inherits the key features of DataAxesFormats.jl:

- Support for both in-memory and persistent data storage
- Thread-safe implementation using read/write locks
- Ability to import and export AnnData objects
- Support for views and adapters
- Chaining repositories for efficient reuse of data
- Flexible data model based on axes, vectors, matrices, and scalar data
- Explicit support for grouped axes
- Simple query language for common operations
- Control over data layout and support for both dense and sparse
  matrices

## Status

This package is in early development. The API is subject to change based
on user feedback. Comments, bug reports, and PRs are welcome!

### Future Plans

In future releases, we plan to implement a dplyr-like API for dafrjulia
to make it even more intuitive for R users. This will allow you to use
familiar verbs like [`filter()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html),
`select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()` with dafrjulia objects,
combining the power of the Julia implementation with the ergonomics of
the tidyverse.
